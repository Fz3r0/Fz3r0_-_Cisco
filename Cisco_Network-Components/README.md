## Network Components

| **Component**          | **Description** | **Comparison** | **Specification** | **Real-Life Example** |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Hosts** | Devices connected to a network that communicate with other devices. They can be clients or servers. | Hosts include PCs, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices. Some hosts only request services (clients), while others provide them (servers). | Identified by an IP address to communicate within a network. | A laptop using a web browser to access an online store. |
| **Clients** | Hosts that request services from a server. | Clients depend on servers for information and resources. | Runs software like browsers or email clients. | A smartphone using Gmail to check emails. |
| **Servers** | Hosts that provide services to clients. | Can be dedicated machines or software running on a PC. | Needs specialized software like web, email, or file server software. | A web server hosting a company's website. |
| **Peer-to-Peer Network** | A network where devices function as both clients and servers. | Easier to set up than a client-server model but less secure and scalable. | No centralized administration; devices share resources directly. | Two coworkers sharing files directly from their computers. |
| **End Devices** | Devices that act as sources or destinations of network communication. | Include PCs, smartphones, printers, and IP phones. | Each has a unique network address. | A network printer receiving print jobs from multiple users. |
| **Intermediary Devices** | Devices that connect hosts and manage data traffic in a network. | Include routers, switches, and firewalls. | Responsible for directing data packets based on network addresses. | A Wi-Fi router distributing internet access to home devices. |
| **Network Media** | The physical means through which data is transmitted. | Can be copper cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals. | Determines transmission speed, distance, and reliability. | A fiber-optic internet connection in an office. |
| **LAN (Local Area Network)** | A network that connects devices within a limited area like a home or office. | Faster and more secure than WANs but limited in range. | Uses Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or both. | An office network with multiple PCs and printers. |
| **WAN (Wide Area Network)** | A network that connects multiple LANs over a large geographic area. | Covers more distance but is slower and less secure than LANs. | Uses leased lines, MPLS, or VPNs. | A companyâ€™s branch offices connected via MPLS. |
| **Internet Connections** | Methods used to connect to the internet. | Can be wired (DSL, fiber) or wireless (5G, satellite). | Affects speed, reliability, and latency. | A home using fiber internet for streaming and work. |
| **Reliable Networks** | Networks designed to provide consistent service. | Require redundancy, fault tolerance, scalability, and quality of service (QoS). | Ensures uptime and efficient data delivery. | A hospital network with backup connections and priority for medical devices. |
| **Network Trends** | Emerging technologies that influence how networks are used. | Includes BYOD, cloud computing, IoT, and remote work. | Affects network security, bandwidth needs, and device compatibility. | Employees using personal laptops for work via VPN. |
| **Network Security** | Measures taken to protect networks from threats. | Includes firewalls, encryption, and access controls. | Essential for preventing unauthorized access and data breaches. | A firewall blocking malicious traffic from reaching a corporate network. |
| **IT Professional** | A person responsible for maintaining and securing networks. | Can specialize in networking, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. | Requires certifications like CCNA, CWNA, or Security+. | A network administrator configuring routers and switches for a company. |
