# **Cisco StackWise: Technical Overview**

## **What is Cisco StackWise?**

Cisco **StackWise** is a switch stacking technology that allows multiple physical switches to operate as a single logical unit. It is primarily used in Cisco **Catalyst** series switches, providing high availability, simplified management, and increased scalability for enterprise networks.

Cisco StackWise is a powerful technology for creating a highly available and scalable switch network with **centralized management** and **high-speed interconnectivity**. However, its **cost** and **hardware dependency** make it less suitable for networks requiring vendor diversity or distributed locations. **For high-performance, low-latency environments, StackWise is an optimal choice, whereas trunked switches offer flexibility and cost savings.**


## Cisco StackWise: **Key Features**

| **Feature**               | **Description** |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Single Control Plane**  | All switches in the stack function as a single entity, with one switch acting as the **Master** and others as **Members**. |
| **High Availability**     | If the Master switch fails, another switch in the stack takes over without interrupting network operations. |
| **High-Speed Backplane**  | Switches are connected using Cisco‚Äôs proprietary stacking cables, with speeds up to **480 Gbps (StackWise-480)**. |
| **Unified Configuration** | Managed as a single switch with a single IP address, simplifying network administration. |
| **Scalability**           | Allows adding or removing switches without network downtime. |
| **Redundancy Support**    | Load is distributed across multiple switches, preventing single points of failure. |


## Cisco StackWise: **Supported Switch Models and Technologies**

| **Catalyst Series** | **Stacking Technology**          | **Backplane Speed** | **Compatible IOS** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **2960-X**         | FlexStack-Plus                  | 40 Gbps            | IOS LAN Base, LAN Lite |
| **2960-XR**        | FlexStack-Plus, FlexStack-Extended | 40 Gbps            | IOS IP Lite, IP Base |
| **3650**           | StackWise-160                   | 160 Gbps           | IOS XE |
| **3850**           | StackWise-480                   | 480 Gbps           | IOS XE |
| **9300**           | StackWise-480, StackWise Virtual | 480 Gbps           | IOS XE |
| **9400**           | StackWise Virtual               | N/A                | IOS XE |
| **9500**           | StackWise Virtual               | N/A                | IOS XE |

> **Note:**
> - **StackWise** requires proprietary stacking cables for physical stacking.
> - **StackWise Virtual** enables logical stacking via fiber links without dedicated stacking cables.



## **Stacking Technologies: Differences & Capabilities**

| **Technology**         | **Connection Type**   | **Max Bandwidth** | **Stacking Method** |
|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **FlexStack-Plus**     | Dedicated stacking cables | 40 Gbps          | Physical Stacking |
| **FlexStack-Extended** | Stacking over fiber  | 40 Gbps          | Physical Stacking (Extended Range) |
| **StackWise-160**      | Proprietary stacking cables | 160 Gbps         | Physical Stacking |
| **StackWise-480**      | Proprietary stacking cables | 480 Gbps         | Physical Stacking |
| **StackWise Virtual**  | Fiber (No stacking cables) | N/A              | Logical Stacking |



## **StackWise vs. Switches Connected via Trunk**

| **Comparison Factor**    | **Cisco StackWise** | **Switches Connected via Trunk** |
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Management**          | Managed as a single switch with one IP. | Each switch requires individual configuration. |
| **Redundancy**          | Automatic failover; if Master fails, another switch takes over. | Requires Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or dynamic routing for redundancy. |
| **Performance**         | Up to **480 Gbps** dedicated stacking bandwidth. | Limited by trunk bandwidth (**1G, 10G, 40G, or 100G**). |
| **Failover Speed**      | Fast failover with no reconvergence delay. | STP may introduce delays during reconvergence. |
| **Configuration Complexity** | Simple, single-device configuration. | Requires VLAN configuration, inter-switch routing, and STP tuning. |
| **Cost**                | Higher due to proprietary stacking hardware. | More cost-effective using standard Ethernet or fiber links. |
| **Scalability**         | Easily scalable with plug-and-play stacking. | Adding switches requires manual trunk and VLAN configuration. |


## **Pros and Cons of StackWise**

### ‚úÖ **Advantages**

‚úî **Simplified Management**: Managed as a single entity with one IP address.
‚úî **High Performance**: Dedicated stacking bandwidth up to 480 Gbps.
‚úî **Failover Redundancy**: Automatic Master switch reassignment in case of failure.
‚úî **Scalability**: Add/remove switches dynamically without downtime.
‚úî **Unified Configuration**: No need for STP tuning or VLAN trunking between stacked switches.

### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**

‚ùå **Higher Cost**: Requires proprietary Cisco stacking hardware and cables.
‚ùå **Hardware Dependency**: Only works with compatible Cisco Catalyst models.
‚ùå **Physical Limitations**: Stacked switches must be in close proximity due to stacking cable length constraints.


## **Use Cases**

### ‚úÖ **When to Use StackWise** 

- Large enterprise networks requiring **high availability and redundancy**.
- Environments where **centralized management** and **scalability** are critical.
- Data centers or network closets with multiple **Cisco Catalyst switches**.

### ‚ùå **When to Use Trunk Links Instead**

- When connecting **switches from different vendors**.
- If switches are **geographically dispersed** and cannot be stacked physically.
- When looking for a **more cost-effective** solution using standard Ethernet links.
