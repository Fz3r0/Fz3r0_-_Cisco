# CCNA Breakdwon & Roadmap

Whether you're a beginner or enhancing your expertise, this roadmap has got you covered!

## 1. Networking Fundamentals

### Networking Basics:
- Understanding networks: LAN, WAN, WLAN, MAN, and CAN.
- Bandwidth vs. Throughput.

### Network Devices:
- Roles of Router, Switch, Hub, Bridge, Modem, Access Point, and Firewalls.

### Cables and Connectors:
- Copper (UTP, STP) and Fiber (Single-Mode, Multi-Mode).
- Common connectors like RJ45, LC, and SC.

### Protocols:

- Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
- Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)
- ARP, ICMP, etc.

## 2. OSI and TCP/IP Models

### OSI Model:

- 7 layers explained: From Physical to Application.
- Encapsulation and decapsulation process.

### TCP/IP Model:

- Layers: Network Access, Internet, Transport, and Application.
- Comparison with OSI.

## 3. IP Addressing

### IPv4 Addressing:

- Classes (A, B, C) and CIDR notation.
- Subnetting concepts: Network, Host, Broadcast.

### IPv6 Addressing:

- Address structure and types: Unicast, Multicast, Anycast.

## 4. Subnetting and VLSM

Subnet mask calculations.
Efficient IP use with VLSM in real-world scenarios.

##  5. Switching
Switch Basics: How switches forward frames using MAC tables.
VLANs: Traffic segregation with VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP).
STP: Spanning Tree Protocol to prevent loops.
EtherChannel & Port Security: Aggregation and securing ports.

##  6. Routing
Static vs. Dynamic Routing.
Routing Protocols: RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, BGP (overview).
Administrative Distance and Routing Tables.

## 7. WAN Technologies
PPP, MPLS, Metro Ethernet, and VPNs.

## 8. Security
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Standard vs. Extended.
NAT: Static, Dynamic, and PAT.
Wireless Security: WPA2/WPA3, TKIP, AES encryption.

## 9. Troubleshooting
Essential commands: ping, traceroute, show ip route.
Tools: Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 10. Automation and Programmability
Python basics for networking.
Overview of SDN, Cisco DNA Center, and APIs.

## 11. Cisco Device Configuration
Accessing devices via console, SSH, Telnet.
Configuring hostnames, IPs, VLANs, and routing protocols.
Labs: Static routes, VLAN creation, Inter-VLAN routing.

## 12. Exam-Specific Preparation
Practical labs and scenarios with tools like Packet Tracer and GNS3.
Focus on troubleshooting tickets and simulations.

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Pair theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice for the best results. Tools like GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer, and lab environments will help you bring these concepts to life!
