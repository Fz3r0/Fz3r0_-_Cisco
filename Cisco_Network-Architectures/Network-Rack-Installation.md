According to the **TIA-942-C (2024)** standard, in the sections covering *equipment area design* and *rack layout*, the following principles are established:

* **Equipment must be installed following principles of stability, load, and maintainability.**
  → “Heavy equipment should be placed in the lower portion of the rack to maintain stability and lower center of gravity.”

* **Unobstructed airflow must be ensured.**
  → “Maintain front-to-back airflow paths and avoid blocking exhaust vents with power strips or cable bundles.”

* **PDUs must be installed so that they do not interfere with airflow or maintenance.**
  → “Power distribution units should be mounted vertically in the rear or sides of racks whenever possible.”

* **Structured cabling and electrical wiring must be physically separated.**
  → “Separation between power and data cabling shall be maintained to minimize interference and ease maintenance.”

* **Accessibility:** all equipment must be removable or replaceable without affecting other devices.
  → “Equipment shall be accessible from the front for operation and from the rear for service, without obstruction.”

**Practical translation:**
UPS units at the bottom, PDUs on the sides, switches and patch panels at the top or middle, servers in the mid-lower section.
