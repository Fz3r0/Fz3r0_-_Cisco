# üß† What are **Switches** in Networking?

Switches are the **backbone of modern local networks (LANs)**.  
They connect devices like computers, printers, and servers within a building or campus so they can communicate efficiently.

> Think of a switch like a super-smart mailman üì¨ ‚Äî it knows exactly where to send each message on your network.

## üï∞Ô∏è A Brief History: From Hubs to Switches

| Era        | Device      | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1980s‚Äì90s  | **Hubs** ü™ù | Sent data to *all* ports. Dumb and chatty. |
| Late 90s   | **Bridges** üåâ | Smarter than hubs, filtered traffic by MAC. |
| 2000s+     | **Switches** ‚ö° | Fast, efficient, MAC-learning devices that forward frames only to the right port. |

## üß± Switch Layers Explained: L1 vs L2 vs L3

| Layer | Name        | Function | Example | Used For |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|----------|
| L1    | Physical    | Transmits bits (no logic) | Ethernet hub (obsolete) | ü™ê Bare signal relay |
| L2    | Data Link   | Forwards frames based on **MAC addresses** | Most enterprise switches | üñß VLANs, segmentation |
| L3    | Network     | Forwards packets based on **IP addresses** | Multilayer switches | üåê Inter-VLAN routing, static/dynamic routing |

> üîé L2 Switch = ‚Äúsmart power strip‚Äù  
> üß† L3 Switch = ‚Äúrouter built into a switch‚Äù

## üîå Modern Switch Features (2020s and beyond)

‚úÖ PoE (Power over Ethernet)  
‚úÖ 802.1X NAC integration  
‚úÖ VLAN tagging / trunking  
‚úÖ Stacking (single control plane for multiple switches)  
‚úÖ NetFlow / SNMP / Telemetry  
‚úÖ SDN Support (Software-defined networking)

> üß™ Some enterprise switches even support containerized services (like Docker)!

## üîÑ Cisco vs Other Vendors: Key Differences

| Feature                  | Cisco üá∫üá∏               | Aruba üá≥üá±              | Juniper üá∫üá∏             | TP-Link / Ubiquiti üåç         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| CLI / OS                 | IOS / NX-OS / IOS-XE    | AOS-CX / ArubaOS       | Junos OS                | Web GUI + CLI                 |
| Licensing                | Feature-based licenses üí∏ | Included in hardware   | Subscription or fixed   | Mostly license-free           |
| Automation Support       | Cisco DNA, Netconf/YANG  | REST APIs, Ansible     | SaltStack, PyEZ         | Limited / Basic REST          |
| Focus                    | Enterprise / Data Center | Campus / Wireless-first| Telcos / Service Core   | Small/medium business         |
| Price                    | $$$                     | $$                     | $$$                     | $                             |

> üí° Cisco = robust and complex  
> üí° Aruba = simple and wireless-integrated  
> üí° Juniper = strong in ISPs & automation  
> üí° Ubiquiti = budget-friendly but limited

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Example

You're setting up a new office:

- Use **L2 switches** on each floor for device access
- Use an **L3 core switch** for routing between VLANs
- Deploy **PoE switches** for IP phones and access points
- Centralize with **Cisco DNA Center** or **Aruba Central**

---

## üéì TL;DR

| Concept      | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| Switch       | Connects devices in a network (smart forwarding) |
| L2 Switch    | Works with MAC addresses (VLANs, segmentation) |
| L3 Switch    | Routes IP packets (inter-VLAN, static/dynamic routes) |
| Vendors      | Cisco = enterprise, Aruba = wireless/campus, Juniper = ISPs, Ubiquiti = SMB |
